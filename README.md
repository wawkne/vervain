Welcome to Lumira software. Here we are creating new software to help you become the developer that you wish you were. Lumira was founded in 2025 by user [@oopsite](https://github.com/oopsite) and has since been developing and maintaining the Vervain programming language developed in the [Rust language](https://rust-lang.org).

##
## Vervain

Vervain is a statically typed programming language that can be used for all sorts of things. It runs on the Vervain interpreter. Now, you may be asking... Where does the word Vervain come from? Well, if you enjoy The Vampire Diaries, you may know. For those who don't know however, it comes from the plant; vervain. In the TVDU universe, it was used to harm Vampires.

##
## Installing Vervain

Installing Vervain will be easy. The language is not finish yet, so please wait for the team at Lumira to finish writing the interpreter. So far, the only person on the team is me.
